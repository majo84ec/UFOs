# UFOs

## Overview.

For this project we will create a dynamic table to Dana's website using Javascript and HTML, allowing the users filter information for multiple criteria at same time in order to provide them a better analysis.

## Results.

UFO database contains a lot of infomation displayed in a table. However,a filter was created to give the user ability to search by selecting any of the following criteria: Date, City, State, Country and Shape, narrow the amount of data and support user analysis.

- Data: mm/dd/yyyy
- City: Full Name of city 
- State: XX 
- Shape: Light,circle, triangle, unknown, etc.

## Summary

A drawback of this page is that once the filter is selected, there is not a option to reset or clean information that is contained in each box.

Recommendations for further development:

- Insert a reset button for the filter so the users can do it automatically instead to deleted each field manually.
- Drop down menu to choose the filter criteria.
- Insert a filter for the duration considerating a range.
