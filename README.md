# UFOs

## Overview.

For this project we will create a dynamic table to Dana's website using Javascript and HTML, allowing the users filter information for multiple criteria at same time in order to provide a better analysis.

## Summary.

UFO database contains a lot of infomation displayed in a table. To make it user friendly where created . This information is displayed in a neat table on a webpage. Unfortunately, there is a lot of information, which makes it cumbersome for users to scroll and view data that would be of interest to them. To ease viewing data, filtering options have been added to the webpage.

A user is given the oppurtunity to filter data based on Date, City, State, Country and Shape of UFO sighted or a combination of any of these criteria. This would allow the users to interactively use the webpage to view only required data.

Here is an example :-

When the webpage is loaded for the first time, all the UFO data is loaded and displayed in a table format as UFO Sightings.

Now the user has the ability to refine their search by selecting any of the filter criteria. Using the "Date" field of 1/4/2010, the table is considerably reduced as it displays only the sightings on 1/4/2010 as seen here.

To drill down further the user can select the "City" as "ca'. The results are seen here.

A user may also choose to filter the data based on "State" as 'ca' and "shape" as 'light' alone. The results are seen here.

This dynamic webpage gives total control to users to filter based on any or multiple criteria as they wish and the page will refresh accordingly as soon as a change is made.

The End result is a presentation of data that is both visually appealing and interactive.
